# Data Preparation

First we must load in the data.

```{r}
cards <- readxl::read_excel("/Users/brandonleff/Desktop/clashroyale/clashroyale_bnleff/data/cards.xlsx")
```

Now we must change the data type for the `rarity` and `type` variables turning them into factors.

```{r}
cards$rarity <- factor(cards$rarity, labels = c("Common", "Epic", "Legendary", "Rare"))
cards$type <- factor(cards$type, labels = c("Building", "Spell", "Troop"))
```

Now let's double check the data frame is correct now.

```{r}
cards
```
